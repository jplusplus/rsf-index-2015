## Installation

Install `node` and `npm` then run:

```bash
make install
```

You can now start serving static files with gulp!

```bash
make run
```

## Configure Crowdin *(optional)*

This project relies on Crowdin to manage interface translations. To be able to submit and download translations from Crowdin, you have to follow 2 simple steps.

**Create a copy of Crozdin configuration file:**

```bash
cp crowdin.yaml.template crowdin.yaml
```

**Edit the new file ```crowdin.yaml``` to add your API key ([grab it here](https://crowdin.com/project/rsf-index-2015/settings#api)):**


```yaml
project_identifier: rsf-index-2015
base_url: https://api.crowdin.com
preserve_hierarchy: true
api_key: <ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>

files:
  -
    source: /locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.json
    translation: /locale/%two_letters_code%/LC_MESSAGES/%original_file_name%
```

You can now run ```make crowdin_download``` to grab translations from the Crowdin website.
